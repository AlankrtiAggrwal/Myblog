  Brands manufacturing apparels with the vision of “see now, buy now” kind of retail environment is the fast fashion. These brands use innovative methods to cut short the supply chain and immediately distribute the product which was recently witnessed on a catwalk show, celebrity media, or is either trending. This combined with the constantly increasing desire of people in today’s world to wear acquire new look, and the FOMO of missing out on a trend is the reason due to which the clothing is made in such a haste deeming the quality along with the cost of the product extremely low. Companies neglect the quality of merchandise and the damage to the human and physical resources owing to the paucity of time, as any delay in the distribution gives the advantage to its competitors. Along with that increased spending on such clothes along with the democratization of designer clothes is allowing the brands to bank on “ocean of clothing”. Such companies are striking gold, making millions, by making such massive amount of sales of cheaply prices, low quality products. Moreover, the fast changing consumer demand and launch of new trendy knock-off products way too often leads to a ‘throw-away’ attitude. According to clothes waste charity the average garment is only worn 10 times before it is thrown away. Additionally, the gamut of clothes these brand churn out tot up to 80 billion garments a year which is over 10 clothes for per person on earth. Adding to the woes, it's 400% more than it produced 20 years ago.<br>

  <b><i><h2 style="color:#696d7d">The 4 to 52 seasons shift</b></i></h2><br>

  <p style="font-size:17px;color:#696d7d;text-align=justify">
  You will be completely shaken up after you understand how there was a drift to these fast-fashion trends producing quick, cheap, and disposable clothes. Initially, the fashion industry would take sufficient time to anticipate the consumer preferences, design clothes accordingly, buy and treat fabrics, manufacture and distribute them, introduce their new collection and renew their inventory for four seasons a year, that is, winter, spring, summer, and fall. However, the tables turned upside down when these four seasons a year to 52 micro seasons a year. In other words, there was the introduction of a new collection of apparel every week throughout the year. Quick Response Manufacturing and dynamic assortment helped the brand to achieve the latter.  Manufacturing trendy clothing by acquiring raw material beforehand followed by streamlined distribution refers to quick response management. After that, selling new products (dynamic assortment) was strictly followed. Moreover, companies leveraged real-time data to regulate the market forces, forecast trend, and scour social media
  for feedback. Fashion giants like Zara, H&M, UNIQLO, GAP, Forever 21, Topshop, Esprit, Primark, Fashion Nova, and New Look are towering supply of stocks at all times by replicating the trends as they appear in real-time. The plethora of products offered by them owing to the mass production of clothing attracts the customers and never lets them feel irked while shopping. Even so, this was the basic strategy of quick fashion; other innovative strategies have also been adopted by the major giants. Zara’s strategy to produce more than 10,000 pieces per annum which stand in stark contrast with the industry average of 2000 to 4000 pieces along with the ownership of an extremely short supply chain makes it the dominant one in the industry. H&M focuses on the production of original creations rather than knock-offs with collaborations with incredibly elite designers. In early 2021, for example, it launched a collection designed by Simone Rocha. According to Fast Company, “apparel companies make 53 million tons of clothes into the world annually. If the industry keeps up its exponential pace of growth, it is expected to reach 160 million tons by 2050.”<br>


  <b><i><h2 style="color:#696d7d">Fast Fashion and its fast deteriorating effect</b></i></h2><br>
<p style="font-size:17px;color:#696d7d;text-align=justify">
  The raw material deployed during the product requires tons of resources which include toxic chemicals like polyester, dyes, and synthetics for fabrics, lead, pesticides, and so much more. At first, they employ an unreasonable amount of scarce resources for production and then dispose of the residual leaving the leftover resources damaged. For instance, the production of about 1kg cotton requires about 20,000 liters of water which is equivalent to 24 years of drinking water for one person. Moreover, 200 tons of fresh water per ton of dyed fabric is used for the dyeing and finishing process for all of our clothes. Consider this happening with the dire state of a country like India where about 85 % of the prerequisites in the water of its entire population can be covered by the water used to grow cotton in the country. About 2.5% of global freshwater is used to produce cotton and 1.5 trillion liters of water is used by the fashion industry per year. Now, let’s ignore the wastage of scarce resources for some time. <br>

  <b><i><h2 style="color:#696d7d">Why Slow the Fast Fashion?</b></i></h2><br>
  <p style="font-size:17px;color:#696d7d;text-align=justify">
  From the above data and information, it is crystal clear how fast fashion is jeopardizing the environment, human rights, consumers, animals, natural resources, and economy all together. Thus, the buzz of fashion is getting silences by the talks of sustainability in the industry. The growing awareness en masse about the dire effects on life and greenwashing and the resulting dim hope for a better future puts the fast-fashion retailer into a position to authenticate their sustainable mission statement. The ethical alternative is the slow fashion which promotes the idea of heedful manufacturing, fair working conditions, and good quality, lasting garments. Hence, the best to buy clothing is to buy less and choose natural styling clothes.
